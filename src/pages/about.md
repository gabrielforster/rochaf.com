I'm a software engineering student and a full-stack web developer. I'm passionate about coding and learning new things. I'm currently working at [Adapcon](https://www.adapcon.com.br/).

Had my first contact with code when I was 15 and did a terminal calculator in C. I've been coding ever since. Improving my skills and learning new things every day. Since then, I'm motivated by the idea of helping people and making daily processes easier.

Recently, I graduated from high school as and System Development Technician. In these three years, I've learned a lot about programming and how to solve problems. I've also learned how to work in a team and how to be a good team member. Most of my tech knowledge comes from this course and personal research.

I'm currently studying Software Engineering at [Catolica SC](https://www.catolicasc.org.br/).

In my current job as a full-stack developer I've been working with Vue.js, NodeJS along Serverless functions, and AWS. I've also been using some other technologies in personal projects like React.js, Next.js, Express, NestJS, MySQL and MongoDB.
